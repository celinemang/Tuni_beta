# Taste of Uni (TUni) - College Campus Food App

## Inspiration
From the net nutrition website to the campus dining Instagram, Vanderbilt students have been struggling to navigate the ways in which they can decide what to eat on a daily basis. In order to combine all the necessary information required to make an informed decision on where to go for a meal on campus, our team developed a college campus food app, Taste of Uni (TUni).

## What it does
TUni is designed to streamline the dining experience for Vanderbilt students. The app provides live reviews on dining hall menus, waiting times, highlights the top 3 popular dining halls, and offers a more user-friendly and accessible menu page. Additionally, students can receive notifications for pop-up events hosted by Vanderbilt Dining, such as farmers' markets or free merchandise events.

## How we built it
TUni was built using React Native for the frontend to ensure cross-platform compatibility. The backend is supported by Node.js and MongoDB, providing a robust and scalable architecture. We leveraged native components and custom-designed elements for the UI to enhance user engagement.

## Challenges we ran into
Implementing features from our AdobeXD design using JavaScript and React Native posed challenges. While we successfully implemented the basic features of our app, not all features were fully realized.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully created a prototype demo of our app with UI design elements and features. Additionally, we coded many of the basic features using JavaScript and React Native, showcasing our app through Expo.

## What we learned
This project provided valuable insights into the app-making process, JavaScript, Expo, React Native, and the importance of collaboration with friends and teammates.

## What's next for TUni
Our future plans for TUni include fully implementing all planned features and providing the app with a database that produces real-time data from the campus dining halls.
